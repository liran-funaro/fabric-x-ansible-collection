## Tasks

### ping

> Check the committer gRPC endpoint

Validate that the Fabric-X Committer RPC port is reachable. Uses `committer_rpc_port` on host deployments and skips the direct host check in Kubernetes mode.

```yaml
- name: Check the committer gRPC endpoint
  vars:
    # RPC port exposed by the selected committer component.
    committer_rpc_port: 7051
    # Enable Kubernetes deployment mode.
    committer_use_k8s: false
    # Selects the OpenShift deployment branch.
    committer_use_openshift: false
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: ping
```

### k8s/ping

> Check the committer Kubernetes services are reachable

Probes configured Kubernetes NodePort values and LoadBalancer-exposed service ports for external reachability.

```yaml
- name: Check the committer Kubernetes services are reachable
  vars:
    # Kubernetes NodePort value used by the external RPC Service port. Defining this variable enables the NodePort Service; the value is set as the static `nodePort` in the Service spec.
    committer_k8s_rpc_node_port: 31051
    # Kubernetes NodePort value used by the external metrics Service port. Defining this variable enables the NodePort Service; the value is set as the static `nodePort` in the Service spec.
    committer_k8s_metrics_node_port: 31052
    # Set to `true` to create a LoadBalancer Service entry that exposes the RPC port externally. When undefined or `false`, the RPC port is not included in the LoadBalancer Service.
    committer_k8s_loadbalancer_expose_rpc_port: false
    # Set to `true` to create a LoadBalancer Service entry that exposes the metrics port externally. When undefined or `false`, the metrics port is not included in the LoadBalancer Service.
    committer_k8s_loadbalancer_expose_metrics_port: false
    # RPC port exposed by the selected committer component.
    committer_rpc_port: 7051
    # Metrics port exposed by the selected committer component.
    committer_metrics_port: 9443
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: k8s/ping
```

### openshift/ping

> Check the committer OpenShift deployment

Checks configured OpenShift Routes and reuses the Kubernetes service ping flow.

```yaml
- name: Check the committer OpenShift deployment
  vars:
    # Enable TLS material for the selected component.
    committer_use_tls: false
    # Enable TLS for the monitoring endpoint.
    committer_monitoring_use_tls: "{{ committer_use_tls }}"
    # Specifies the OpenShift Route host.
    committer_openshift_route: "committer-rpc.apps.example.com"
    # Specifies the OpenShift Route host.

  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: openshift/ping
```

### stop

> Stop a committer process

Stop the selected component in bin or container mode. Kubernetes teardown is handled through the teardown entry points instead. Selects the stop path from `committer_component_type` and `committer_deployment_mode`.

```yaml
- name: Stop a committer process
  vars:
    # Committer component handled by the entry point.
    committer_component_type: "coordinator"
    # Deployment mode selected by the role.
    committer_deployment_mode: "{%- if committer_use_bin -%}bin{%- elif committer_use_openshift -%}openshift{%- elif committer_use_k8s -%}k8s{%- else -%}container{%- endif -%}"
    # Enable host-binary deployment mode.
    committer_use_bin: false
    # Enable Kubernetes deployment mode.
    committer_use_k8s: false
    # Selects the OpenShift deployment branch.
    committer_use_openshift: false
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: stop
```

### teardown

> Teardown a selected component

Remove the selected component according to its deployment mode. Sidecar teardown also removes sidecar data. Dispatches by `committer_component_type` and `committer_deployment_mode`.

```yaml
- name: Teardown a selected component
  vars:
    # Committer component handled by the entry point.
    committer_component_type: "coordinator"
    # Deployment mode selected by the role.
    committer_deployment_mode: "{%- if committer_use_bin -%}bin{%- elif committer_use_openshift -%}openshift{%- elif committer_use_k8s -%}k8s{%- else -%}container{%- endif -%}"
    # Enable host-binary deployment mode.
    committer_use_bin: false
    # Enable Kubernetes deployment mode.
    committer_use_k8s: false
    # Selects the OpenShift deployment branch.
    committer_use_openshift: false
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: teardown
```

### wipe

> Remove all committer artifacts

Tear down the selected component and remove binary, config, and crypto assets. Intended for full cleanup of role-managed host artifacts after stopping the component.

```yaml
- name: Remove all committer artifacts
  vars:
    # Enable host-binary deployment mode.
    committer_use_bin: false
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: wipe
```

### fetch_logs

> Collect committer logs

Fetch logs from the selected deployment mode. Dispatches to binary, container, or Kubernetes log collection based on deployment flags.

```yaml
- name: Collect committer logs
  vars:
    # Enable host-binary deployment mode.
    committer_use_bin: false
    # Enable Kubernetes deployment mode.
    committer_use_k8s: false
    # Selects the OpenShift deployment branch.
    committer_use_openshift: false
    # Enable container deployment mode.
    committer_use_container: "{{ (not committer_use_bin) and (not committer_use_k8s) and (not committer_use_openshift) }}"
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: fetch_logs
```

### effective_address

> Resolve the effective committer metrics address

Compute the address used to reach a committer metrics endpoint from outside its own host. Sets `committer_effective_metrics_address` as an Ansible fact on the calling host. Resolution priority is OpenShift Route, then Kubernetes NodePort, then the plain host port. Accepts a `committer_host` variable so the task can be called from any host in the inventory. All committer-specific variables are read from `hostvars[committer_host]`.

```yaml
- name: Resolve the effective committer metrics address
  vars:
    # Inventory host whose committer metrics endpoint should be resolved.
    committer_host: "committer-validator-1"
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: effective_address
```

### get_metrics

> Retrieve Prometheus metrics

Query the component metrics endpoint and print the response body. Delegates address resolution to the `effective_address` entry point.

```yaml
- name: Retrieve Prometheus metrics
  vars:
    # Metrics port exposed by the selected committer component.
    committer_metrics_port: 9443
    # Enable mTLS for the monitoring endpoint.
    committer_monitoring_use_mtls: "{{ committer_use_mtls }}"
    # Remote config directory managed by the role.
    committer_remote_config_dir: "{{ remote_config_dir }}"
    # Enable mTLS for the selected component.
    committer_use_mtls: false
    # Remote config directory used by delegated crypto tasks.
    remote_config_dir: "/opt/fabricx/committer/config"
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: get_metrics
```

### db_init

> Initialize the committer state database

Creates the committer's system tables and namespaces by dispatching to the binary or container path. Required from committer Must run after the state database is up and before the committer components start, since the validator cannot open its RPC port until the schema exists. The Kubernetes and OpenShift modes are not implemented and only emit a warning.

```yaml
- name: Initialize the committer state database
  vars:
    # Enable host-binary deployment mode.
    committer_use_bin: false
    # Enable container deployment mode.
    committer_use_container: "{{ (not committer_use_bin) and (not committer_use_k8s) and (not committer_use_openshift) }}"
    # Enable Kubernetes deployment mode.
    committer_use_k8s: false
    # Selects the OpenShift deployment branch.
    committer_use_openshift: false
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: db_init
```

### start

> Start a committer component by type

Dispatch startup to the selected committer component. `committer_component_type` selects validator, verifier, coordinator, sidecar, or query-service. `committer_deployment_mode` selects bin, container, Kubernetes, or OpenShift.

```yaml
- name: Start a committer component by type
  vars:
    # Committer component handled by the entry point.
    committer_component_type: "coordinator"
    # Deployment mode selected by the role.
    committer_deployment_mode: "{%- if committer_use_bin -%}bin{%- elif committer_use_openshift -%}openshift{%- elif committer_use_k8s -%}k8s{%- else -%}container{%- endif -%}"
    # Enable host-binary deployment mode.
    committer_use_bin: false
    # Enable Kubernetes deployment mode.
    committer_use_k8s: false
    # Selects the OpenShift deployment branch.
    committer_use_openshift: false
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: start
```

### crypto/setup

> Prepare crypto material

Transfer cryptogen artifacts or enroll with Fabric CA for the selected component. When `committer_use_k8s` is true, also create the Kubernetes secret for the component. Uses `organization` to determine Fabric CA enrollment or cryptogen artifact paths.

```yaml
- name: Prepare crypto material
  vars:
    # Organization definition consumed by crypto and sidecar configuration tasks.
    organization:
      name: "Org1"
      domain: "org1.example.com"
      role: "peer"
      fabric_ca_host: "fca-org1"
      peer:
        name: "committer-sidecar"
        secret: "committer-sidecarPWD"
      users:
        - name: "committer-sidecar"
          secret: "committer-sidecarPWD"
    # Enable Kubernetes deployment mode.
    committer_use_k8s: false
    # Selects the OpenShift deployment branch.
    committer_use_openshift: false
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: crypto/setup
```

### crypto/fetch

> Fetch TLS certificates

Fetch the committer TLS CA certificate and server certificate to the control node. This task runs only when `committer_use_tls` is true. Stores fetched files under `fetched_artifacts_dir` for downstream trust bundle generation.

```yaml
- name: Fetch TLS certificates
  vars:
    # Remote config directory used by delegated crypto tasks.
    remote_config_dir: "/opt/fabricx/committer/config"
    # Crypto material base name for the committer.
    committer_crypto_name: "{{ organization.peer.name | default(inventory_hostname) }}"
    # Remote config directory managed by the role.
    committer_remote_config_dir: "{{ remote_config_dir }}"
    # Control-node directory that stores fetched artifacts.
    fetched_artifacts_dir: "/tmp/fabricx/artifacts"
    # Enable TLS material for the selected component.
    committer_use_tls: false
    # Committer component handled by the entry point.
    committer_component_type: "coordinator"

      fabric_ca_host: "fca-org1"
      peer:
        name: "committer-sidecar"
        secret: "committer-sidecarPWD"
      users:
        - name: "committer-sidecar"
          secret: "committer-sidecarPWD"
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: crypto/fetch
```

### bin/install

> Install the committer binary

Install the committer binary through the shared `bin` role Go installer entry point. Uses the configured Git repository, ref, package path, and binary name.

```yaml
- name: Install the committer binary
  vars:
    # Binary name managed by the committer role.
    committer_bin_name: committer
    # Go package path used by the shared binary installer.
    committer_bin_package: "{{ committer_git_hub_url }}/{{ committer_git_repo }}/{{ committer_source_code_package }}"
    # Git host used for the committer source repository.
    committer_git_hub_url: github.com
    # Git repository that contains the committer sources.
    committer_git_repo: hyperledger/fabric-x-committer
    # Git ref used for building or installing the binary.
    committer_git_commit: v1.0.4
    # Go package path used as the build or install target.
    committer_source_code_package: cmd/committer
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: bin/install
```

### bin/build

> Build the committer binary

Build the committer binary through the shared `bin` role Go build entry point. Produces the local committer binary artifact later transferred to target hosts.

```yaml
- name: Build the committer binary
  vars:
    # Binary name managed by the committer role.
    committer_bin_name: committer
    # Git host used for the committer source repository.
    committer_git_hub_url: github.com
    # Git repository that contains the committer sources.
    committer_git_repo: hyperledger/fabric-x-committer

    committer_git_commit: v1.0.4
    # Go package path used as the build or install target.
    committer_source_code_package: cmd/committer
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: bin/build
```

### bin/db_init

> Initialize the committer state database with the committer binary

Runs `committer init-db` in the foreground against the validator's generated configuration. Runs without tmux and without log collection, since this exits rather than staying up as a service.

```yaml
- name: Initialize the committer state database with the committer binary
  vars:
    # Binary name managed by the committer role.
    committer_bin_name: committer
    # Generated config file name used by the selected component.
    committer_config_file: "config-{{ committer_component_type }}.yml"
    # Timeout for the one-off `committer init-db` state database initialization. Passed straight through as `--timeout`, so it takes a Go duration string. Creating the system tables and namespaces is quick on an idle database, but a YugabyteDB cluster that is still electing leaders can take appreciably longer.
    committer_db_init_timeout: 5m
    # Remote config directory managed by the role.
    committer_remote_config_dir: "{{ remote_config_dir }}"
    # Remote config directory used by delegated crypto tasks.
    remote_config_dir: "/opt/fabricx/committer/config"
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: bin/db_init
```

```yaml
- name: Stop a committer binary
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: bin/stop
```

### bin/rm

Remove the installed committer binary from the target host. Uses `committer_bin_name` as the target executable name.

```yaml
- name: Remove the committer binary
  vars:
    # Binary name managed by the committer role.
    committer_bin_name: committer
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: hyperledger.fabricx.committer
    tasks_from: bin/rm
```

### bin/fetch_logs

    tasks_from: bin/transfer
```

### container/start

> Start the committer container

Run the container for the selected committer component, with its generated configuration directory mounted read-only. For the sidecar, also ensures the data directory exists and mounts it as a second volume. `committer_component_type` selects the CLI subcommand and, for the sidecar, whether the data volume and a longer wait timeout apply. Configures the image-native gRPC healthcheck with TLS verification when `committer_use_tls` is enabled.

```yaml
- name: Start the committer container
  vars:
    # Committer component handled by the entry point.
    committer_component_type: "coordinator"
    # Generated config file name used by the selected component.
    committer_config_file: "config-{{ committer_component_type }}.yml"

    # Remote config directory managed by the role.
    committer_remote_config_dir: "{{ remote_config_dir }}"
    # Remote data directory managed by the role.
    committer_remote_data_dir: "{{ remote_data_dir }}"
    # RPC port exposed by the selected committer component.
    committer_rpc_port: 7051
    # Enable TLS material for the selected component.
    committer_use_tls: false
    # Remote config directory used by delegated crypto tasks.
    remote_config_dir: "/opt/fabricx/committer/config"
    # Remote data directory used by delegated sidecar tasks.

    committer_container_config_dir: /config
    # Container name used by the committer container helper.
    committer_container_name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    # Timeout for the one-off `committer init-db` state database initialization. Passed straight through as `--timeout`, so it takes a Go duration string. Creating the system tables and namespaces is quick on an idle database, but a YugabyteDB cluster that is still electing leaders can take appreciably longer.
    committer_db_init_timeout: 5m
